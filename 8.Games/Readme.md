# PetProjects-Java
Right now - games from Javarush.ru

Apparently you need JavaFX installed - somehow the project fixed itself :) 

All games are working, but since I've lost my code on Javarush.ru (cannot login into my old account), I cannot give
 you links to actually playing them (apparently there's a plugin that translate java into javascript)
